_Component to integrate with [Traeger WiFire Grills][traeger]._

**This component will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`sensor` | Shows various temperature readings from the grill or accessories
`climate` | Allows temperature control of the grill and probe
`number` | Allows minutes input to the timer and cook cycles.
`switch` | Allow SuperSmoke, Keepwarm, and connectivity switch
`binary sensor ` | Show values of boolean entities

## Installation (Manual)

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `traeger`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/traeger/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Traeger"

## Platform Details
Some of the platforms are fairly self explanatory, others could use a little more explaining. Below are more details on some of those platforms.
### Grill State Sensor
This sensor aligns with the status values in the Traeger app.
State | Description
-- | --
`offline` | Powered off (or not accesible)
`sleeping` | Standing by (power switch on, screen off)
`idle` | Standing by (power switch on, screen on)
`igniting` | Igniting the fire pot
`preheating` | Ignition is complete, heating to set temperature
`manual_cook` | Cooking mode
`custom_cook` | Cooking mode, using preset cook cycle
`cool_down` | Cool down cycle
`shutdown` | Cool down cycle complete, heading to sleep
`unknown` | Unkown state, report to developers

### Heating State Sensor
This sensor tries to provide more useful insight into the heating status of the grill. Many of these values can be trigger off of to provide notifications that are not available in the Traeger app.
State | Description
-- | --
`idle` | Not in igniting, preheating, cooking or cool_down modes
`preheating` | Igniting or preheating (and under 165°F)
`heating` | Trying to get temperature **up** to new target temperature
`cooling` | Trying to get temperature **down** to new target temperature
`at_temp` | Temperature has reached the target temperature (and is holding at ±20°F of target temperature)
`over_temp` | Was `at_temp`, but is now more than 20°F **above** target temperature
`under_temp` | Was `at_temp`, but is now more than 20°F **below** target temperature
`cool_down` | Cool down cycle

### Probe State Sensor
This sensor provides triggers for useful probe events such as being close to the target temperature or reaching the target temperature.
State | Description
-- | --
`idle` | Probe target temperature is **not** set (or grill is not in igniting, preheating or cooking modes)
`set` | Probe target temperature **is** set
`close` | Probe temperature is within 5°F of target temperature
`at_temp` | Probe alarm has fired
`fell_out` | Probe probably fell out of the meat (Probe temperature is greater that 215°F)

### Cook Cycle Number Entity
This number input provides the step increment the grill is currently at. Cook cycles are defined to this number entity via `set_custom_cook` service.
Value | Description
-- | --
`0` | Idle. HA based cook cycle is not active.
`1+` | Cook Cycle is currently at **val** step as shown by ATTR `curr_step`
